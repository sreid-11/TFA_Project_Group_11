We have implemented the use of pandas and numpy to answer questions on the 311 dataset.

Top10 Notebook:
1. Imported the necessary Python libraries (NumPy and Pandas)
    For more information on these Python libraries, please visit 
    their respective official documentation:
        Pandas - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable
        NumPy - https://www.numpy.org
2. Read the dataset into a pandas dataframe
3. Performed data analysis on the dataset to find the top 10 incidents
    for a given zip code in New York City and returns the count of each
    of the top 10 incidents in that zip code.

Parking:
1. Import the neccessary libraries: Pandas and NumPy. 
2. Create a pandas dataframe of the 311 Service Requests dataset.
3. Find the number of complaints in the dataset where the complaint type is "Illegal Parking" and then divide this number by the number of total complaints.
4. Repeat step 3 for the complaints in your specified zip code. 
5. Create and if/else statetment where if the fraction of Illegal Parking complaints in your zip code is greater than the fraction in the total dataset, the variable "higher_parking_proportion" = True, and if it is less than then "higher_parking_proportion" = False
